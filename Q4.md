const Whiteboarding = Q4

<!-- Question Prompt:  -->
Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

<!-- Clarification...-->
Can I use javascript?
Do I need to account for numerical inputs? is it okay if the string contains a number within it?
What kind of edge cases should we account for?
What should be returned if there is an empty string?

<!-- inputs and outputs -->
Input: "hello"
Output: false

Input: "copyright"
Output: true

<!-- Error Handling and Edge Cases to Consider -->
check for empty inputs. 
check for non-string inputs.
In either case, return an error message

<!-- Problem Breakdown: -->
1. Start with an if statement that checks for a few edge and error cases. See if the input is a string, check if the input is empty. Return an error if needed.
2. Create a variable for finding a duplicate that initially starts as false. If a duplicate is found this will change to true. This is what is returned at the end.
3. Write two for loops that will go through the string.
4. If statement makes a comparison between EACH index of the strings.
    a. If the elements of two indexes are the same AND the two indexes are not of the same value, then change the found duplicate variable to true and return the variable
    b. If that never happens, found duplicate will remain false, and will be returned.


<!-- Code:  -->
```js
const uniqueChecker = (input) => {
  if (typeof input !== "string" || input === "") {        //check for type and input errors
    let error = "Please enter a string";
    return error;
  }

  let foundDuplicate = false;                           //this will be returned and will act as our true or false statement
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {              //loop through the string with two index variables
    for (let j = 0; j < input.length; j++) {
      if(input[i] === input[j] && i !== j) {            //index elements have to be the same AND the index values must be different
        foundDuplicate = true;
        return foundDuplicate;                          //update the variable to true, break the loop and return the variable
      }
    }
  }
  return foundDuplicate;                                //if no duplicate is ever found then the variable remains false 
}
```
