const Whiteboarding = Q1

<!-- Question Prompt:  -->
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.


<!-- Clarification...-->
Do we need to deal with number inputs?
Do we need to account for punctuation? 
What kind of edge cases should we account for?
What should be returned if there is an empty string?

<!-- inputs and outputs -->
Input: "Hey hi hello"
Output: "Hey%20hi%20hello"

Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"
Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

<!-- Error Handling and Edge Cases to Consider -->
check for empty strings. 
check for numerical inputs

  
<!-- Problem Breakdown without recursion: -->
1. start with an if statement that checks for a few edge and error cases. See if the input is a string, check if the input is empty
2. create an empty result variable that we can characters into
3. write a for loop that goes through each character in the word, pushing each character into the the result string. If the character is a blank space, we replace it with %20 before pushing that into the result/

<!-- Code without recursion -->
const spaceReplacer = (input) => {
  if (typeof input !== "string" || input === "") {
    let error = "Please enter a string of words";
    return error;
  }

  let result = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    const character = input[i];
    if (character === " ") {
      result += "%20";
    } else {
      result += character;
    }
  }
  return result;
}

input: spaceReplacer("hello goodbye");
expected output: "hello%20goodbye"

input: spaceReplacer() or spaceReplacer(77)
expected output: "Please enter a string of words"
