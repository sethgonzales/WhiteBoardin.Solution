const Whiteboarding = Q1

<!-- Question Prompt:  -->
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.


<!-- Clarification...-->
Can I use javascript and JS methods?
Do we need to deal with number inputs?
Do we need to account for punctuation? 
What kind of edge cases should we account for?
What should be returned if there is an empty string?

<!-- inputs and outputs -->
Input: "Hey hi hello"
Output: "Hey%20hi%20hello"

Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"
Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

<!-- Error Handling and Edge Cases to Consider -->
check for empty inputs. 
check for non string inputs.
In either case, return an error message

  
<!-- Problem Breakdown without recursion: -->
1. start with an if statement that checks for a few edge and error cases. See if the input is a string, check if the input is empty
2. create an empty result variable that we can characters into
3. write a for loop that goes through each character in the word, pushing each character into the the result string. If the character is a blank space, we replace it with %20 before pushing that into the result.
4. return the result string when finished.

<!-- Code without recursion -->
```js
const spaceReplacer = (input) => {
  if (typeof input !== "string" || input === "") {        //check for type and input errors
    let error = "Please enter a string of words";
    return error;
  }

  let result = "";                              //empty result string
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {      //for loop that will go through each character of our word    
    const character = input[i];                 //define a character as the input at a specific index
    if (character === " ") {
      result += "%20";                          //add %20 into the results array for any blank spaces
    } else {
      result += character;                      //add the character to the results array
    }
  }
  return result;
};
```

input: spaceReplacer("hello goodbye");
expected output: "hello%20goodbye"

input: spaceReplacer() or spaceReplacer(77)
expected output: "Please enter a string of words"



<!-- Problem Breakdown with recursion -->
1. We will write an outer function that checks for initial error and returns either an error message, or if no error, a result 
2. We will write an inner function that will run recursively. This function will check a character at each index of the string. 
3. If that index value is a letter, add it to the result string, but if it is an empty space, replace it with %20. 
4. Each time a character is checked, 1 is added to the index value, and the function is called again.
5. The recursive function breaks when the index value becomes equal to or greater than (just in case!) the length of the word.
6. The outer function then returns the result string. Done!

<!-- Code with recursion:  -->
```js
const spaceReplacer = (input) => { //this is the inner recursive function that will be called. Here is how it works...
  if (typeof input !== "string" || input === "") {     //same error handling as above
    let error = "Please enter a string of words";
    return error;
  }  

  let result = "";
  const recursiveReplace = (input, index) => {
    if (index >= input.length) {                     //break out of the loop once the index value is equal to the length of our word
      return; 
    }

    const currentChar = input[index];               //define the current character as the input at a specific index
    if (currentChar === " ") {     
      result += "%20";
    } else {
      result += currentChar
    }

    index ++;                            //increase index value by one
    recursiveReplace(input, index)      //call the function recursively 
  }

  recursiveReplace(input, 0)            //call the inner function
  return result;                        //return the result
};
```
input: spaceReplacer("hello goodbye");
expected output: "hello%20goodbye"

input: spaceReplacer() or spaceReplacer(77)
expected output: "Please enter a string of words"
