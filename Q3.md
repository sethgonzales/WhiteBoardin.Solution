const Whiteboarding = Q3

<!-- Question Prompt:  -->
Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

<!-- Clarification...-->
Can I use javascript?
This is only checking for a consecutive repeat of characters? If a character shows up again, then it does not get compressed?
Do I need to account for numerical inputs? is it okay if the string contains a number within it?
What kind of edge cases should we account for?
What should be returned if there is an empty array?

<!-- inputs and outputs -->
Input: "aaabccdddda"
Output: "3ab2c4da"

<!-- Error Handling and Edge Cases to Consider -->
check for empty inputs. 
check for non-string inputs.
In either case, return an error messager

<!-- Problem Breakdown without Recursion: -->
1. start with an if statement that checks for a few edge and error cases. See if the input is a string, check if the input is empty
2. create an empty result variable that we can characters into
3. create a counter that starts at 1. This will be updated at each character if the same character exists next to it 
4. create a for loop that looks at each index in the string and compares it to the index next to it.
5. if the adjacent index is the same, then we add one to a counter and move to the next index
    a. if that index is the same then we add one to the counter and move to the next index... etc.
6. if it is not the same, then we check if the counter is greater than 1
    a. if it is greater than 1, then we print out the counter number and index element. We add the element to the results, reset the counter, and move on to the next element.
    b. if it is NOT greater than 1, we add the index element to the result, reset the counter to 1, and move on to the next element.
7. once finished we return the resulting string



<!-- Code without Recursion  -->
```js
const compressString = (input) => {
  if (typeof input !== "string" || input === "") {        //check for type and input errors
    let error = "Please enter a string";
    return error;
  }

  let result = "";                   //empty result string
  let count = 1;                     //initialize count for each character as 1

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    if (input[i] === input[i + 1]) {              //check to see if the next indext value is the same
      count++;                                    //if it is add 1 to the counter and go to the next index
    } else {                                      //if it is not the same...
      if (count > 1) { 
        result += `${count}${input[i]}`;          //add the count and the input to the result string if the count is greater than 1
      } else {
        result += input[i];                       //add in the input to the result string 
      }  
        count = 1;                                //reset the counter to 1
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
input: compressString("aaabccdddda")
expected output: "3ab2c4da"

input: compressString() or compressString(77), etc
expected output: "Please enter a string"




<!-- Problem Breakdown with Recursion: -->
1. We will write an outer function that checks for initial error and returns either an error message, or if no error, a result 
2. We will write an inner function that will run recursively. This function will check a character at each index of the string. 
3. The methods of the inner function are basically the same as what is in the for loop.
4. The recursive function breaks when the index value becomes equal to or greater than (just in case!) the length of the word.
5. The outer function then returns the result string. Done!

<!-- Code with Recursion -->
```js
const compressString = (input) => { //this is the inner recursive function that will be called. Here is how it works...
 if (typeof input !== "string" || input === "") {        //same error handling as above
    let error = "Please enter a string";
    return error;
  }

  let result = "";
  let count = 1; 

  const recursiveCompress = (input, index) => {
    if (index >= input.length) {                     //break out of the loop once the index value is equal to the length of our word
      return; 
    }

    if (input[index] === input[index + 1]) {              //check to see if the next indext value is the same
      count++;    
    } else {                                      //if it is not the same...
      if (count > 1) { 
        result += `${count}${input[index]}`;          //add the count and the input to the result string if the count is greater than 1
      } else {
        result += input[index];                       //add in the input to the result string 
      }  
        count = 1;                                //reset the counter to 1
    }

    index ++;                            //increase index value by one
    recursiveCompress(input, index)      //call the function recursively, looking at the next index element
  }

  recursiveCompress(input, 0)            //call the inner function
  return result;                        //return the result
};
```
