const Whiteboarding = Q5

<!-- Question Prompt:  -->
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().



<!-- Clarification...-->
Does the array only contain numbers?

<!-- inputs and outputs -->
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]
Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

<!-- Error Handling and Edge Cases to Consider -->

```js
let arraySorter = (inputArray) => {                           //bubble array method compares two elements at a time and swaps them if one is larger than the other 
  for (let i = 0; i < inputArray.length - 1; i++) {           //outer loop. This controls how many times we go through the array. Each index (j and j+1) is compared until we reach the end of the array. That represents 1 pass, or 1 i value. We then repeat these passes until i < arrayInput.length - 1, to ensure that all swaps have been
                                                              // Both loops stop at one before the end of the array since we are garunteed that the last number in the array will be the largest by the time we get there
    for (let j = 0; j < inputArray.length - 1; j++) {         //inner loop. This moves through each of the elements in the array
      if (inputArray[j] > inputArray[j + 1]) {
        const swap = inputArray[j];                           //store the value of inputArray[j] in a variable. We will change the value of this index in the next step so we have to store it here
        inputArray[j] = inputArray[j + 1];                    //make the value of inputArray[j] now equal inputArray[j + 1]
        inputArray[j + 1] = swap;                             //make the value of inputArray[j + 1] now equal to inputArray[j] 
      }                                                       //if the j !< j+1 then the looping continues (goes from j to j+1 and compares it to the next index) and the array is unchanged 
    }                                                         //these methods alter the actual array itself, so we do not need to make a new onee
  }
  return inputArray;
}
